## Project Overview
A Django-based web application that automates the process of fetching, rewriting, and publishing travel articles, with a focus on SEO and user experience.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Frontend:** Django Templates, Bootstrap (or your preferred CSS framework)
- **Scraping:** Requests, BeautifulSoup, or Scrapy
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API (or similar)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (recommended) or SQLite
- **Task Scheduling:** Celery + Redis (or Django-Q)
- **Deployment:** Docker, Gunicorn, Nginx, (or your preferred stack)

## Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up a Python virtual environment
3. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
4. Configure environment variables (API keys, DB, etc.)
5. Run initial migrations
6. Create a superuser
7. Start the development server

## Step-by-Step Development Guide

### 1. Django Project Setup
- Initialize a new Django project: `django-admin startproject travelpoints`
- Create core apps: `scraper`, `articles`, `users`, etc.
- Set up database settings in `settings.py`
- Configure static and media files

### 2. Scraper Development
- Use Requests/BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to fetch articles from target sites
- Parse and extract relevant content (title, body, images, etc.)
- Store raw articles in the database
- Handle errors, rate limits, and site structure changes

### 3. AI Integration
- Integrate with OpenAI API (or similar) for rewriting/polishing articles
- Create a service to send raw content and receive improved text
- Store AI-processed articles in the database
- Optionally, add moderation or review step

### 4. Content Management & Publishing
- Build Django models for articles, categories, tags, etc.
- Create admin interfaces for managing content
- Implement auto-publishing logic (publish after AI processing)
- Ensure proper formatting (headings, images, links)

### 5. Website Design & Frontend
- Design responsive templates using Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS
- Implement article listing, detail, and search pages
- Add navigation, user authentication (optional), and contact forms
- Optimize for mobile and accessibility

### 6. Automation & Scheduling
- Use Celery (with Redis) or Django-Q for background tasks
- Schedule scraping and AI processing jobs (e.g., daily)
- Monitor task status and handle failures

### 7. SEO Optimization
- Add meta tags, Open Graph, and structured data
- Generate sitemaps and robots.txt
- Optimize URLs, headings, and image alt text
- Integrate with Google Analytics/Search Console

### 8. Deployment
- Containerize the app with Docker
- Set up Gunicorn and Nginx for production
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Deploy to your preferred cloud provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
